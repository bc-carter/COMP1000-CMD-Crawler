## Entities
The Dungeon Crawler contains 3 entities known the the player:
 * M - monsters
 * G - gold
 * @ - the player
 
## Movement 
The player can move using the above controls, '.' represents an empty space, which the player can move onto, the player can also move over gold. '#' represents walls, which the user cannot move over/pass, the same principle applies to monsters ('M'), though the user will take damage if they collide with them!
