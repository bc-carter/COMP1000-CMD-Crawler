## What to do!
* install the required software ([mono sdk](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/), git, visual studio or notepad++, )
* Add your code into the required methods within the CMDCrawler.cs
* build the project on command line using `dotnet cake --target=Build --rebuild=true --verbosity=Diagnostic`
* test your project using `dotnet cake --target=Test --verbosity=Quiet`
* push your changes once you completed a part of it and iteratively work on it
* **SUBMIT** your _final_ codebase by the deadline
 
## What to avoid!
* do not modifiy the build process
* change the used libraries or
